      <p>The move of the retail space to e-commerce has been accelerated at an incredible rate thanks to the pandemic but it has also created a brand new shop doorway that has pushed the creativity in this space. The “envelope” for what can be achieved with what is almost always a one-time use part of the packaging journey is innovative, exciting and in many cases very well considered. The challenges are inevitable, supply and demand being the greatest of these. As we emerge from this challenging times, here at CPPC there is no doubt that this is now one of the first conversation points with any packaging development brief. Here at CPPC towers Sustainability is always front and centre for us and our partners and as such infinitely recyclable substrates such as Aluminium and Glass are always a joy to work with. Treated correctly, and in conjunction with the right secondary packaging, these can almost become the closed loop productions we all hope for these days.</p>
